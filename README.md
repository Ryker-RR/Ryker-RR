im Ryker-RR , but you can just call me Ryker.
my pronouns are he/him/his.
im learning lua, but i plan to learn C++ or Java in the future.
i just think C++ and Java are harder because just to write text in the output for Java and C++ its like 100 lines but in lua and python its just print("hello") or something.
i also play games, like Roblox, Minecraft (Java and Bedrock edition), Subway Surfers (not alot), and other games. i also sometimes make games in Roblox Studio.
also, i use ZeroBrane Studio to make other lua projects. i know Roblox Studio also uses lua, but roblox studio cant do as many things as normal lua so whatever.
but thats about it! sorry for the long text.
